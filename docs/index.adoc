Hands-on developer intro to our platform, CLI, Content Studio, headless API, and the free hosting tier.

TIP: *Just looking for a demo?* - https://enonic.com/sign-up[Sign up for a free Enonic account^]. Create a new solution based on the `Headless Demo` template to get a live demo for a similar setup as this tutorial.

== Introduction

This guide will show you how to:

* set up a local developer environment
* create an Enonic app
* use Content Studio
* customize the app by adding a new content type
* access and use the GraphQL API
* optionally - deploy your app to a live server in the Cloud

== Install CLI

The https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli[Enonic Command Line Interface^] is an essential tool for developers working with Enonic.

If you have `npm` on your device, run this command:

  npm install -g @enonic/cli

If not, here are some https://developer.enonic.com/start[alternative ways to install Enonic CLI^]

To verify that the CLI has been installed, run `enonic -v`. This should output the version of your installed CLI.

To see all available options, simply run `enonic`.

TIP: To upgrade, use `enonic latest`. If there are new versions you will see instructions on how to upgrade.

== Create a sandbox

A https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/development/sandboxes[sandbox^] is a local development instance of the platform - Enonic XP. Create a sandbox called `mysandbox` by running this command in your terminal:

  enonic sandbox create mysandbox -t essentials -f

NOTE: `-f` flag will force using the most recent release of Enonic XP.

Start the sandbox with this command:

  enonic sandbox start mysandbox --dev

NOTE: Dev mode optimizes the development process.

image::sandbox-start.gif["Booting the sandbox in the terminal", width="1024px"]

== Create an app

https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/apps[Enonic apps^] are used to ship everything from content models, to code and platform extensions.

*Open a new terminal window* and create your first Enonic app by running this command:

  enonic project create -r tutorial-intro -n com.example.myapp -d myapp -v 1.0.0 --sb mysandbox

This command will:

* use the GitHub repo `github.com/enonic/tutorial-intro` as a starter
* to create an app called `com.example.myapp`
* in the directory `myapp` setting version number to `1.0.0`
* and link it to `mysandbox` which you created earlier

TIP: A pre-compiled standard version of this app is also available on https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/intro[Enonic Market^].

=== Project structure

Inside the `myapp` directory you should now have a file structure looking something like this:

.Selected files from the app code:
[source,files]
----
docs/ <1>
samples/ <2>
src/
 main/
  resources/
   assets <3>
   controllers <4>
   i18n <5>
   import <6>
   site/
    content-types/ <7>
    x-data/ <8>
gradle.properties <9>
----

<1> The documentation you are reading now
<2> Code samples that will be used in this guide
<3> Client-side assets
<4> https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/controllers[Server-side controllers and templates^]
<5> https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/i18n[Localisation bundles^]
<6> Sample content
<7> https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types[Content Type schemas^]
<8> https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/x-data[X-data schemas^]
<9> App name and other settings

== Deploy the app

Assuming `mysandbox` is still running in another Terminal window, run these commands:

  cd myapp
  enonic dev

The last command will build and deploy the app to `mysandbox` - then keep watching for changes in the code to automatically rebuild as you work on it.

[NOTE]
====
Look for the following output to verify that the app has been built:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s
    3 actionable tasks: 3 executed
    Waiting for changes to input files...
====

== Admin dashboard

Let's have a look at the Sandbox' web interface. Open http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080^] in your browser (or just click the link).

You should now see the XP boot page:

.XP Boot page
image::xp-boot.png[The XP boot page, 1085w]

The boot page provides an overview of the sandbox, including installed application, as well as the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config[standard configuration files^].

NOTE: `My App` should be in the list, together with other applications that were automatically installed when you created the sandbox.

Click btn:[Log In as Guest] to open the XP admin dashboard. You should now see the following:

.The XP admin dashboard
image::xp-dashboard.png[The XP admin dashboard, {image-xl}]

You are now on the admin dashboard. The right hand menu (aka `XP menu`) enables navigation between admin tools. Admin tools may be injected as extensions via applications.

NOTE: If things don't look exactly the same, don't worry. In every new version of XP the background picture gets updated. Also, admin dashboard is automatically localized - based on your browsers preferred language.

== Content management

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It was pre-installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^] as a part of the `Essentials` template when you started the sandbox, and can now be accessed from the XP menu.

*Click btn:[Content Studio]* in the XP menu to launch it.

When your application was installed, it automatically created a content project called `Intro Project` and populated it with content.Since this is the only available project at the moment, Content Studio will automatically open it, revealing the list of sample content.

TIP: The current project is shown at the top of Content Studio.

image::content-studio-in-action.gif["Content Studio with Sample content", width="1024px"]


== Content type: Person

To edit an item, simply select it and click `Edit` in the menu bar, or by using right click. When editing a Person content item, this is what the form looks like in Content Studio. On bigger screens you will also get a preview on the right-hand side.

image::person.png["Person Form", width="1024px"]

The form comes from the content type definition, which is located inside the app. Here is what it looks like:

./src/main/resources/site/content-type/person/person.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/resources/site/content-types/person/person.xml[]
----

When used to create content, it is stored like this:

.Persisted content for Uma Thurman
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "valid": true,
  "displayName": "Uma Thurman",
  "type": "com.enonic.app.hmdb:person",
  "owner": "user:system:su",
  "language": "en",
  "modifiedTime": "2018-07-03T05:58:55.025Z",
  "modifier": "user:system:su",
  "creator": "user:system:su",
  "createdTime": "2018-07-03T05:57:35.292Z",
  "publish": {
    "first": "2024-01-18T12:08:23.167Z",
    "from": "2024-01-18T12:08:23.167Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "photos": "8d47792f-0ae6-4d74-a6e4-bab0e8d2374b",
    "bio": "Uma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly unorthodox and Eurocentric family",
    "dateofbirth": "1970-04-29"
  },
  "x": {
    "com-enonic-app-hmdb": {
      "SoMe": {
        "imdb": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000235/"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

=== X-Data: Social media

When editing a Person, you'll notice an additional subset of fields inside the Content form with title `Social Media`. This is strictly speaking a separate form, injected into the Person content type - we call it "eXtended data" (or just "x-data").

image::some.gif["Social Media x-data form", width="1024px"]

X-data can be applied across multiple content types. In this app for instance, the `Social Media` form is also available on the `Movie` content type. More interestingly, X-data can even be injected from a different application - at runtime.

This is what the definition looks like:

./src/main/resources/site/x-data/some/some.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/resources/site/x-data/SoMe/SoMe.xml[]
----

You can also see what the persisted version looks like in the JSON document above.

== Adding a new content type

Let's do a practical exercise by adding a new content type called `Review` to your app. This will allow you to create reviews of movies.

. From inside the `samples/` folder of your app, *copy or move* the `review/` folder to `src/main/resources/site/content-types/`.
. *Write a review*. Content Studio should pick up the changes immediately. From the Content navigation view click btn:[New], then select content type `Review` and start filling out the form fields in the new content item.
+
image::review.png["Sample Review", width="1024px"]

== Graphql API

The Headless API aka https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/guillotine[Guillotine^] - yes, we take headlessness seriously around here - provides access to all the content within your project. Clients requesting content will naturally only get access to the content they have read-permissions for. The `Intro project` is configured with public read access for everything.

Click the GraphQL icon in the Content Studio's left hand menu to open `Query Playground`. Here you may test and play with the GraphQL API directly.

image::query-playground.png["Query Playground in action", width="1024px"]

The API documentation is available from the Top left `file cabinet icon`. Use the tabs on the top right to query against the Draft or Master branch, accessing the draft and published items respectively.

Want to know more about GraphQL in general? Visit the https://graphql.org[official GraphQL documentation^].

== Sample queries

Below are some example queries you can use for fetching the sample content.

=== Get Persons

.Get display name and _path of the first 3 items in the `/persons` folder:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
 guillotine {
  getChildren(key:"/persons" first:3){
    displayName
    _path
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response:
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "getChildren": [
        {
          "displayName": "Léa Seydoux",
          "_path": "/persons/lea-seydoux"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Jeffrey Wright",
          "_path": "/persons/jeffrey-wright"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Daniel Craig",
          "_path": "/persons/daniel-craig"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

=== Query variables

GraphQL also supports the concept of query variables. Similar to parameters in functions, you may pass variables to a query.

Query variables are defined with JSON. You can add them using the `Variables` button below the query editor.

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "path": "/persons"
}
----

With the variable set, update your query to use the variable. This query should provide the exact same response as it did before.

.The Person query, this time using path as a variable:
[source,GraphQL]
----
query($path:ID!){
 guillotine {
  getChildren(key:$path first:3){
    displayName
    _path
    }
  }
}
----

=== Movies and cast

IMPORTANT: The GraphQL schema is automatically generated from your application and schemas. If you used a different name than `com.example.myapp` when the app was created, you would have to replace both `com.example.myapp:movie` and the GraphQL type `com_example_myapp_Movie` for the query below to work.

.Get display name and the cast of the first movie:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(query: {
      term: {
        field: "type",
        value: {
          string: "com.example.myapp:movie"
        }
      }
    }, first: 1) {
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myapp_Movie {
        data {
          cast {
            actor {
              displayName
            }
            character
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "queryDsl": [
        {
          "displayName": "The Matrix",
          "data": {
            "cast": [
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Keanu Reeves"
                },
                "character": "Neo"
              },
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Carrie-Anne Moss"
                },
                "character": "Trinity"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

== Image handling

In this case, Guillotine plays tag-team with XP's image service, which is capable of delivering real-time cropped and optimized versions of images. In this case we are requesting a 400 x 400px version of the image.

The query below shows the name of actors containing the term `morgan`, and provide a link to a cropped image of the actor.

IMPORTANT: Again, if your app was called something else than `com.example.myapp`, replace `com.example.myapp:person` and `com_example_myapp_Person` for the query below to work.

.Name of persons and a link to 400x400 scaled photo
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(query: {
      boolean: {
        must: [
          {
            ngram: {
              fields: ["_allText"],
              query: "morgan"
            }
          },
          {
            term: {
              field: "type",
              value: {
                string: "com.example.myapp:person"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }, first: 1) {
      ... on com_example_myapp_Person {
    	  displayName
        data {
          photos(first:1){
            ... on media_Image {
              imageUrl(type:absolute scale:"block(400,400)")
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "queryDsl": [
        {
          "displayName": "Morgan Freeman",
          "data": {
            "photos": [
              {
                "imageUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/intro/draft/_/image/7ab1f76a-69a1-490f-b505-6eb6773c7cec:603726cc4fa712aa1b70c7eb64e1349f664494c3/block-400-400/morgan-freeman.jpg"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

When looking at the result in Query Playground, you can see the actual image by hovering over the link:

image::morgan-photo.png["Cropped version of Morgan Freemans image", width="1024px"]

The original higher resolution image is stored as a content item, just like persons and reviews. This is what it looks like from Content Studio:

image::morgan-original.png["The original version of Morgan Freemans photo is widescreen, with a red "autofocus" circle marked around his face", width="1024px"]

NOTE: The red "autofocus" circle, when set, helps the image service to crop the images optimally - as you can see above.


== API endpoint
So far, you've been playing with the API via Content Studio. If you want to access the API endpoint directly, it's available at respectively

* \http://localhost:8080/site/intro/draft (draft items)
* \http://localhost:8080/site/intro/master (published items)

The API can be deployed to a custom domain when you go live. Also, important to notice - the GraphQL API is accessed via HTTP POST method, as such - visiting via a regular browser will render error 404.

TIP: The Chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/altair-graphql-client/flnheeellpciglgpaodhkhmapeljopja[Altair^] lets you browse any GraphQL API, simply by pointing it to the API URL.

== Deploying to Production

To deploy your application to production, you'll need Enonic XP running on a server. Here we'll use Enonic's free tier for your solution.

[TIP]
====
If you are looking for other hosting options, Enonic XP is open source, and https://developer.enonic.com/docs/hosting[can be deployed pretty much anywhere^].
====

. Start by *https://enonic.com/sign-up[signing up^]* for a forever-free account. You must complete the verification steps before you can move on.
. then *Log in to the https://console.enonic.com[Enonic Console^]*
. and *create a new solution* from the menu: `Solutions -> Essentials -> Create`. Complete the solution wizard steps using your preferences.
+
This will spin up an instance of Enonic XP, similar to your local sandbox but this time on a real server in the Cloud.
+
. Once the solution has started, *authenticate the CLI* by running this command from your project folder:
+
  enonic cloud login
+
. After successful authentication *install your app* using this command:
+
  enonic cloud app install
+
IMPORTANT: You must execute the command from your app folder.
+
TIP: Alternatively upload the app from the Console directly: `Solutions -> <Your solution> -> Applications -> Install`.
+
The app file is located in your project folder i.e. `build/libs/myapp.jar`.
+
. *Expose your API* by creating an ingress in the Enonic Cloud console: `Solutions -> <Your solution> -> Ingresses -> Create`.
+
Give it a suitable name i.e. `Intro API`, and use the following values:
+
* Environment: keep the default/selected value
* Target: `/site/intro`
* Domain: keep the default/selected value
* Path: `/api`
* ID provider: leave empty
+
. *Select the ingress* to reveal the link to your API on the right.
. *Visit the URL* to see the `Query Playground` API browser.
+
NOTE: The API browser can be disabled by changing the configuration of the `Guillotine app`.
+
.To access the GraphQL endpoint for your published content, append `/master` to the API URL.
+
NOTE: Remember, the GraphQL API only accepts `POST` requests, so the browser will only show a 404 at this point.


== Dive deeper

🎉 Awesome! You made it to the end.

In the process, you created an Enonic XP sandbox, built and customized your own app, ran GraphQL queries, got to know the Enonic CLI and our SaaS service.

As you may already imagine, the Platform is capable of so much more. Did you for instance know that Enonic has a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework[JavaScript framework], complete with https://www.npmjs.com/org/enonic-types^[TypeScript definitions^] the entire platform API? You may use it in your apps to extend and customize the Platform as you like.

To continue the journey, we recommend visiting the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/tutorials[Enonic tutorials] section of the Developer Portal.

Bon voyage!
