It's time for the final act - sign up for a free account and deploy your app on a live server.


== API endpoint

So far, you've been playing with the API via Content Studio. If you want to access the API endpoint directly, it's available at respectively

* \http://localhost:8080/site/intro/draft (draft items)
* \http://localhost:8080/site/intro/master (published items)

The API will be served from a real domain when you go live. Also, important to notice - the GraphQL API is accessed via `HTTP POST` method, as such - visiting via a regular browser will give you a 404 error.

TIP: The Chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/altair-graphql-client/flnheeellpciglgpaodhkhmapeljopja[Altair^] lets you browse any GraphQL API, simply by pointing it to the API URL.

== Deploy to server

To deploy your application to production, you'll need Enonic XP running on a server. Here we'll use Enonic's free tier, follow these steps:

=== 1. Sign up

[TIP]
====
If you are looking for other hosting options, Enonic XP is open source, and https://developer.enonic.com/docs/hosting[can be deployed pretty much anywhere^].
====

. Start by *https://enonic.com/sign-up[signing up^]* for a forever-free account. You must complete the verification steps before you can move on.
. then *Log in to the https://console.enonic.com[Enonic Console^]*
. and *create a new solution* from the menu: `Solutions -> Essentials -> Create`. Complete the solution wizard steps using your preferences.
+
This will spin up an instance of Enonic XP, similar to your local sandbox but this time on a real server in the Cloud.


=== 2. Upload your app

. Once the solution has started, *authenticate the CLI* by running this command from your project folder:
+
  enonic cloud login
+
. After successful authentication *install your app* using this command:
+
  enonic cloud app install
+
IMPORTANT: You must execute the command from your app folder.
+
TIP: Alternatively upload the app from the Console directly: `Solutions -> <Your solution> -> Applications -> Install`.
+
The app file is located in your project folder i.e. `build/libs/myapp.jar`.


=== 3. Explose the API

. Expose your API by *creating an ingress* in the Enonic Cloud console: `Solutions -> <Your solution> -> Ingresses -> Create`.
+
Give it a suitable name i.e. `Intro API`, and use the following values:
+
* Environment: keep the default/selected value
* Target: `/site/intro`
* Domain: keep the default/selected value
* Path: `/api`
* ID provider: leave empty
+
. *Select the ingress* to reveal the link to your API on the right.
. *Visit the URL* to see the `Query Playground` API browser.
+
NOTE: The API browser can be disabled by changing the configuration of the `Guillotine app`.
+
.To access the GraphQL endpoint for your published content, append `/master` to the API URL.
+
NOTE: Remember, the GraphQL API only accepts `POST` requests, so the browser will only show a 404 at this point.


== Dive deeper

ðŸŽ‰ Awesome! You made it to the end.

In the process, you created an Enonic XP sandbox, built and customized your own app, ran GraphQL queries, got to know the Enonic CLI and our SaaS service.

As you may already imagine, the Platform is capable of so much more. Did you for instance know that Enonic has a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework[JavaScript framework^], complete with https://www.npmjs.com/org/enonic-types[TypeScript definitions^] the entire platform API? You may use it in your apps to extend and customize the Platform as you like.

To continue the journey, we recommend visiting the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/tutorials[Enonic tutorials] section of the Developer Portal.

Bon voyage!
