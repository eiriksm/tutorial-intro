Installing the CLI and creating a development sandbox.

== Install CLI

The https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli[Enonic Command Line Interface^] is an essential tool for developers working with Enonic.

If you have `npm` on your device, run this command:

  npm install -g @enonic/cli

If not, here are some https://developer.enonic.com/start[alternative ways to install Enonic CLI^]

To verify that the CLI has been installed, run `enonic -v`. This should output the version of your installed CLI.

To see all available options, simply run `enonic`.

TIP: To upgrade, use `enonic latest`. If there are new versions you will see instructions on how to upgrade.

== Create a sandbox

A https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/development/sandboxes[sandbox^] is a local development instance of the platform - Enonic XP. Create a sandbox called `mysandbox` by running this command in your terminal:

  enonic sandbox create mysandbox -t essentials -f

NOTE: `-f` flag will force using the most recent release of Enonic XP.

Start the sandbox with this command:

  enonic sandbox start mysandbox --dev

NOTE: Dev mode optimizes the development process.

== Create an app

https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/apps[Enonic apps^] are used to ship everything from content models, to code and platform extensions.

*Open a new terminal window* and create your first Enonic app by running this command:

  enonic project create -r tutorial-intro -n com.example.myapp -d myapp -v 1.0.0 --sb mysandbox

This command will:

* use the GitHub repo `github.com/enonic/tutorial-intro` as a starter
* to create an app called `com.example.myapp`
* in the directory `myapp` setting version number to `1.0.0`
* and link it to `mysandbox` which you created earlier

TIP: A pre-compiled standard version of this app is also available on https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/intro[Enonic Market^].

=== Project structure

Inside the `myapp` directory you should now have a file structure looking something like this:

.Selected files from the app code:
[source,files]
----
docs/ <1>
samples/ <2>
src/
 main/
  resources/
   assets <3>
   controllers <4>
   i18n <5>
   import <6>
   site/
    content-types/ <7>
    x-data/ <8>
gradle.properties <9>
----

<1> The documentation you are reading now
<2> Code samples that will be used in this guide
<3> Client-side assets
<4> https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/controllers[Server-side controllers and templates^]
<5> https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/i18n[Localisation bundles^]
<6> Sample content
<7> https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types[Content Type schemas^]
<8> https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/x-data[X-data schemas^]
<9> App name and other settings

== Build the app

Assuming `mysandbox` is still running in another Terminal window, run these commands:

  cd myapp
  enonic dev

The last command will build and deploy the app to `mysandbox` - then keep watching for changes in the code to automatically rebuild as you work on it.

[NOTE]
====
Look for the following output to verify that the app has been built:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s
    3 actionable tasks: 3 executed
    Waiting for changes to input files...
====

== XP Admin

Let's have a look at the Sandbox' web interface. Open http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080^] in your browser (or just click the link).

You should now see the XP boot page:

.XP Boot page
image::xp-boot.png[The XP boot page, 1085w]

The boot page provides an overview of the sandbox, including installed application, as well as the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config[standard configuration files^].

NOTE: `My App` should be in the list, together with other applications that were automatically installed when you created the sandbox.

Click btn:[Log In as Guest] to open the XP admin dashboard. You should now see the following:

.The XP admin dashboard
image::xp-dashboard.png[The XP admin dashboard, 1727w]

You are now on the admin dashboard. The right hand menu (aka `XP menu`) enables navigation between admin tools. Admin tools may be injected as extensions via applications.

NOTE: If things don't look exactly the same, don't worry. In every new version of XP the background picture gets updated. Also, admin dashboard is automatically localized - based on your browsers preferred language.


== Coming up

You're now familiar with the CLI, sandboxes, and even created and built your own app. In the next chapter you'll get familiar with <<cms#, Content Studio and how to manage schemas>>.
